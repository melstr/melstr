## About me
I studied in Ogarev Mordovian State University (Software Engineer bachelor). I had crazy amount of freedom with ideas that
I could implement in there.

During my study I'd tryed and learnt many technologies and knowlege in classes and additional courses. Such as:
- Php, SQL, C++, C#, Python, Matlab
- HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- Project Management frameworks
- Maths, algorithms and data structures
- Network topologies
- and many more...

As for my hobby, I like playing and analyze music. In my senior years of university I was interested in digital audio processing. I've tryed to solve one of
the music beginners' problems - searching for the chords of a song.

**So, I'd made a Chord Recognition program on Python: https://github.com/melstr/ChordRecognition**.

Also, I'd entered master's program in the same university, written and published an [article](http://journal.mrsu.ru/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10.-statyafirsovameleshkin.pdf) (Russian) 
on Chord Recognition problem. 

Unfortunately, I'd found out that I stopped developing my skills there, and I'd decided to abandon the idea of finishing my master's degree in university.

Now I study Java Backend stack (for 1 year+) and I've already moved to Saint Petersburg in the hope of finding a job as a Java Backend developer.
